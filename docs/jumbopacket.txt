The JumboPacket module is used to send packets back and forth between nodes on
the JumboCoin peer-to-peer network.

The structure of each message is defined as follows (using byte ranges):
  [0, 4)    => MAGIC_WORD.  must be 0xFA00AF00
  [4, 6)    => messageType (see jumbopacket.h)
  [6, 10)   => messageLength.  The length of the message data, not including
               MAGIC_WORD, messageType, or messageLength
  [10, ...] => the remaining data, depending on messageType
